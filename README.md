# Gesture-Volume-Control
The Gesture Volume Control program uses hand tracking via a webcam to adjust system volume dynamically based on the distance between the thumb and index finger. It provides real-time visual feedback with a volume bar and percentage, making it a hands-free and interactive way to control audio levels.
